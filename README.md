  - Build
  - Artifact publishing 
  - Image publishing
  - Code Quality 
- AppSec
  - Dependency Vulnerability scanning
  - SAST (Static Application Security testing)
  - Container Vulnerability Scanning 
- Artifact and Image Publishing (If required separately from CI)

## Insights 
The insights workflow sends the pipeline run metrics to New Relic events db based on the New Relic Account ID and API Key provided as secrets.
  
  **How to Consume**
  
  1. Below is the sample reusable workflow trigger, which should be part of the 'main' branch of the repository. It gets triggered , everytime when there is a workflow run completion. By default the workflow trigger file will be part of the repositories which are created from Brightcloud. 
  If the repository is not created from Brightcloud, please follow the below step.
     
     - Copy the workflow file to the **_workflow_** directory in _**main**_ branch.
     
     https://github.com/DigitalInnovation/Cloud-DevSecOps-Reusable-Templates/blob/main/.github/workflows/pipeline-insights-reusable-template.yaml
     
  2. Pipeline Metrics data is being sent to the below event tables in New Relic.
    * **pipelinemetricsdb** -> Stroes the details about the workflow
    * **pipelinejobmetricsdb** -> Stores the details about the Jobs in each workflow
   - Please use the below sample queries to view in New Relic Dashboard (Custom queries can be created based on the data) Or Duplicate the below given Demo Dashboard.
     - * _FROM pipelinemetricsdb SELECT latest(Repository_Name) as 'Repository Name' Facet Repo_ID SINCE 7 days ago_
     - * _FROM pipelinemetricsdb SELECT latest(Total_Duration) FACET Workflow_ID SINCE 7 days ago TIMESERIES 30 minutes LIMIT MAX_
     - * _FROM pipelinejobmetricsdb SELECT latest(Job_Duration) FACET Workflow_ID,Job_Name SINCE 7 days ago TIMESERIES 30 minutes  LIMIT MAX_ 
    OR
   - Duplicate the below Dashbaord.
