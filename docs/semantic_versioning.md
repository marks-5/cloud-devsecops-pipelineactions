## Overview
Releases are deployable software iterations you can package and make available for a wider audience to download and use. Releases are based on Git tags, which mark a specific point in your repository's history. 

Automated release done by GitHub action pipeline. Once changes merged to main branch, pipeline will execute and create tags and release.

Note: Product Team can continue to use **latest** tag, as changes will not break their pipelines.

**Semantic versioning:** ```<MAJOR>.<MINOR>.<REVISION>```
  - Patch releases: 1.0.x
  - Minor releases: 1.x.0
  - Major releases: x.0.0

Pipeline will cover below steps,
1. **Defining Semantic Version**
     - Get Last commit tag
     - Get the commit logs
     - Based on the commit logs(#major/ #minor/ #patch), define semantic version.
2. **Replacing new version in files**
     - As we are refering our composite actions in our repository itself in action.yml files, replacing exiting version with new defined version.
     - Push the changes in the main branch of the repository. 
3. **Creating all three tag**
     - Deleting **latest** tag from the last commit.
     - Creating three tags - ```latest, v<semantic version>, v<semantic version>-<7-digit commitid>```. Eg: latest, v1.0.1, v1.0.1-1234567
7. **Creating Release**
     - Creating GitHub Release for tag ```v<semantic-version>-<7-digit commitid>```
     - Based on the label mentioned in pull request, release notes will be created.
